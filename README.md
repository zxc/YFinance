YFinance
========

* YFinance is a small Python library to pull stock data from Yahoo Finance.


How To
------

* Get a stock's price:

    import yfinance
    yfinance.price('GOOG') # => '368.91'
    
* Get all available information about a stock:
    
    yfinance.get_all('GOOG') # => {...

* Keys for the resulting dictionary are:
    
    price
    change
    volume
    average_daily_volume
    exchange
    market_cap
    book_value
    ebitda
    dividend_per_share
    dividend_yield
    earnings_per_share
    i52_week_high
    i52_week_low
    i50_day_moving_average
    i200_day_moving_average
    price_to_earnings_ratio
    price_to_earnings_growth_ratio
    price_to_sales_ratio
    price_to_book_ratio
    short_ratio

* You can use these to grab just a few data points for a stock:
    
    yfinance.get('GOOG', yfinance.price & yfinance.volume) # => {...

* You can also call each of these as a function:
    
    yfinance.change('GOOG') # => '+2.10'
    yfinance.price_to_earnings_ratio('GOOG') # => '25.04'
